# SparkML : Graphical User Interface for Spark MLlib. 

Developed during the TASSEL hackathon at Buckler Lab for building predictive models for site features. It takes data as a TSV file and uses the Spark MLlib implementation of machine learning algorithms. Example cases include predicting the conservation of a nucleotide based on a set of annotations.
The applicability is not limited to the computational genomics, the framework can be used for any other machine learning task. 


**Algorithms** implemented include :

- Random Forests (classification/regression)
- Gradient Boosted Trees (classification/regression)
- Support Vector Machines (classification)
- Navie Bayes (classification)
- Linear Regression


**Dependencies:**

- Java (> 1.8)
- Spark
- JavaFX
